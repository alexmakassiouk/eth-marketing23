For [6c](#6c) we only use the average constant retention rate for cohort 0 and not the average across all cohorts. The average retention rate for cohort 0 is lower than the average of all cohorts. In addition to discounting the cash flow. The biggest difference is however accounting for cohort 0 and not averaging across all cohorts, since cohort 0 was really unprofitable compared to the other cohorts for last year. If we would have used the average retention rate across all cohorts, we would get almost the same expected CLV. In summary cohort 0, which is the month we are in now, was a much less profitable group of acquired users last year then the other cohorts, and we expect a lower CLV of $\\$12.69$ for this cohort."
